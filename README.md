# Sweeper
This is the final project for cs290 sp2017.

Sweeper is a playable, modern, dynamic Minesweeper.

Upon entering the site, the player is greeted with the options to input board size, and percentage of mines wanted on the field.

The user will notice that they can save their progress, and be given a key to input in the "key" field on returning to the site.

*TL;DR:* This game is fun
